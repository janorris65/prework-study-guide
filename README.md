First of Firsts

## Description

I made a Website, to drink from a firehose, and I did it one line of poor syntax at a time.
I did it because I finally have time to learn these skills. I have more questions and things I wish to create. So it solves the problem of life. I learned the rules of the road of how to make the 'biscuits' of coding.

## Installation

## Usage

It can be used as a building block for messing with more coding options like developing CSS builds. Possibly as a living document of what Ive learned, but Id rather show it.

## License

MIT License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
